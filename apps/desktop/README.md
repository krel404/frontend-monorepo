# NewShades desktop

This is the home of the NewShades desktop and web client.

Some desktop builds can be found on [the release page](https://github.com/NewShadesDAO/front/releases), but until we get automatic updates going the easiest way to follow along is to access the regular web app on [app.newshades.xyz](https://app.newshades.xyz).

## Introduction

_NewShades desktop_ is a [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) web app, using a thin [`Electron`](https://www.electronjs.org/) wrapper to build for desktop. The details might change quickly but at the time of writing we bundle our Javascript with [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/), transpile with [`SWC`](https://swc.rs/); and package, make distributals, and publish our desktop builds with [`Electron Forge`](https://www.electronforge.io/).

## Development setup

Make sure you have [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [`NPM`](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, preferrably through a version manager, like [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), or [`n`](https://github.com/tj/n).

Clone the repo and install dependencies with:

```sh
# You have to run this from the repo root folder
npm install -w desktop
```

Why the `-w desktop`? Read up on npm workspaces [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces).

Copy `.env.template` and tweak the config as you wish. By default the app is setup to talk to our staging API at [staging-api.newshades.xyz](https://staging-api.newshades.xyz/). For more info on how to run the API locally, check out the repo [NewShadesDAO/api](https://github.com/NewShadesDAO/api).

```sh
cp packages/desktop/.env.template packages/desktop/.env
```

Start a local dev server with:

```sh
npm run start-web -w desktop
```

By default this expects the [NewShades API](https://github.com/NewShadesDAO/api) to be running on `localhost:5001`, but you can override that with an environment variable `API_ENDPOINT` if you like:

```sh
API_ENDPOINT=https://api.newshades.xyz npm run start-web
```

Start the desktop client with:

```sh
# This expects the dev server described above to be running
npm run start-desktop -w desktop
```

Note that you only have to run the desktop client when building Electron related features, in most cases just running the web client is enough.

## Deployment

`HEAD` of `main` is automatically deployed to [app.newshades.xyz](https://app.newshades.xyz) with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Desktop builds are currently manual.
